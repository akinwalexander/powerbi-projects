NDIDIA RESTAURANT

Introduction
At The Roothub HQ, there is a high influx of people (residents and
visitors) who troop into the premises to work or learn on a daily
basis. Getting food around the HQ is difficult as it is either too
pricey or not good enough in terms of quality.
To help those who come around, the management has proposed
to set up a restaurant- Ndidia within the premises.


Objectives
Source for data of Nigerians in the food industry, analyze this data
and show key trends and findings as it relates to starting and
running a successful restaurant
